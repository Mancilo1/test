        "## What is FeelNow\n"
        "FeelNow is an app with which you can easily assess and monitor an acute panic attack. It is just like a diary and helps you to keep an eye on your mental health.\n\n"
        "## What can the App do\n"
        "The app is supposed to help you write down important parts of a panic attack or even simply for your anxiety. It simplifies taking notes while feeling distressed by having the option to just choose how you're feeling instead of having to write your feelings down yourself.\n\n"
        "## How do I use it\n"
        "You can create your own login by registering. You will then have a list of important points to assess during an acute attack, such as symptoms, possible triggers, who helped you at that moment or how strongly you felt them. If you do not feel like you're having a panic attack but you do feel anxious, you can do the same in the simpler version.\n\n"
        "## About this App\n"
        "This app is mainly used in English. If needed, there are files available for download after you have successfully logged in, which display the anxiety assessment protocols in German. You can use them as a reference and to help use the app, even if it is not in German. If you are not registered or logged in, you will not have access to the profile page and the anxiety assessment protocols. Once you are logged in, you will be redirected to your profile, where you will have access to your entries, personal data, and the anxiety assessment questions. You can use these questions or go directly to the anxiety assessment protocols if needed. You can log out anytime using the sidebar.\n\n"
        "## Information\n"
        "By clicking on 'Information' in the sidebar menu, you have the possibility to inform yourself about mental health and anxiety disorders, as well as to look up some helpful tricks for your anxiety."
